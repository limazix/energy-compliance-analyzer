# C3: Component - Firestore Trigger (`trigger`)

[<- Back to Firebase Functions Components](./../03-firebase-functions-components.md)

## Description

The **Firestore Trigger** component (`processAnalysisOnUpdate` in `functions/src/index.js`) is the entry point for the background analysis processing pipeline. It is a Firebase Function triggered by update events (specifically `onUpdate`) on documents within a specific collection in Firebase Firestore.

## Responsibilities (Behaviors)

*   **Event Observation:**
    *   Monitors the `users/{userId}/analyses/{analysisId}` collection in Firestore.
    *   Is configured to be triggered when a document in this collection is updated and the `status` field transitions to a specific value, such as "summarizing_data".
*   **Context Extraction:**
    *   When triggered, receives the document snapshot before and after the update, as well as context parameters (like `userId` and `analysisId`).
    *   Extracts relevant information from the updated document, such as the CSV file path in Firebase Storage (`powerQualityDataUrl`), filename (`fileName`), user ID, and analysis ID.
*   **Invocation of Processing Logic:**
    *   Calls the main pipeline orchestration function (`processAnalysisFn` in `functions/src/processAnalysis.js`), passing the extracted data.
*   **Event Filtering:**
    *   May include logic to prevent unnecessary reprocessing by checking the document's previous and current state (e.g., not reprocessing if status is already "completed" or "error", unless it's an explicit restart).

## Technologies and Key Aspects

*   **Firebase Functions SDK:**
    *   `functions.firestore.document().onUpdate()` to define the trigger.
    *   `change` object (with `change.before` and `change.after`) to access document data.
    *   `context` object to get parameters like `context.params.userId`.
*   **Firebase Admin SDK (Firestore):** Indirectly, as it interacts with data provided by the trigger, which is from Firestore.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** A fundamental component in an event-driven architecture, reacting to state changes in data.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Defined in the `functions/src/index.js` file and exported for deployment.
    *   May have runtime configurations (region, timeout, memory) defined in `firebase.json` or during deployment.
*   **Idempotency (Consideration):** Ideally, the triggered logic should be idempotent or have mechanisms to handle multiple invocations for the same event (though Functions generally guarantee "at least once" delivery).

## Interactions

*   **Triggered by:** Updates in Firebase Firestore.
*   **Invokes:** Pipeline Orchestrator (`processAnalysisFn`).
*   **Input:** Firestore event data (`change` and `context` objects).
*   **Output:** None (invokes another function).
